## Bomffas here!

I have been working as a front-end developer for over 8 years. During this time, I have worked with basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript), frameworks such as React.JS/Next.JS with Typescript, and I have also worked with Vue.js.

Regarding styling, I have used SASS (SCSS) and Styled Components. In addition to using UI libraries such as Veutify and Material-UI.

I have worked with Git on Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket, in addition to developing components for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and templates for WordPress.

I am a person who likes to contribute to the construction of a cohesive, reliable and results-oriented work environment. I believe that any complex challenge can be solved if faced with caution.

I am skilled at mediating conflicts and creating a space where ideas can flow.
